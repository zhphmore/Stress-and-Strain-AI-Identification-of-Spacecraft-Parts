# Stress and Strain AI Identification of Spacecraft Parts

This Project belongs to Beijing Institute of Spacecraft Environment Engineering (BISEE), cooperated with College of Engineering, Peking University.

The code was developed by P.H. Zhang (2025).

## Background

The development of spacecraft represents the progress of modern society. Due to the unique characteristics of spacecraft motion and the space environment, high requirements are proposed on spacecraft parts. A key step during spacecraft part design is to quickly locate the dangerous zone on part and acquire overall stress and strain distribution under given working conditions.

Traditional methods use simulation software such as Abaqus to solve the problem. However, simulation software are slow, cumbersome, and having high learning threshold. A new approach is to use neural networks as surrogation of simulation software, which has high computational efficiency, significantly reduce time costs.

## Abstract

In this project, we have two aircraft parts, named Large Part and Small Part. The structure of parts keep confidential. Each part is attached with several strain gauges. The location of strain gauges are fixed and the strain of them can be accurately measured. Actually, The strain of strain gauges are the only information we can get. We aim to design a program, taking the strain of strain gauges only as input, to output stress and strain at every location throughout the part.

We trained two neural networks as AI model to solve the problem, named NNA and NNB. This two neural networks work in series. NNA takes the strain of strain gauges only as input, and outputs the external load of the part. NNB takes the output of NNA as input, which is the external load of the part, and outputs stress and strain at every location throughout the part.

We choose Abaqus for simulation to generate dataset for each part. We used parallelization to accelerate simulation and obtained tens of thousands of data. The datasets are abundant enough to train AI model.

We designed a humanized interface which encapsulates the above functions. As long as obtaining the strain of the strain gauges measured by device, the AI ​​model can immediately calculate the external load and stress strain distribution of the part. Then the stress and strain cloud map will be immediately drawn on the interface, while inidcating the location with the maximum stress.

## Overview

- **Spacecraft parts**: Two parts in total, Large Part and Small Part.

- **User interface**: (*/UI*) QtDesigner to design UI. PyQt5 to write code.

## Datasets

### How to make datasets

- Model the parts (Mesh, Assembly, Step, Interaction, Boundary): Large Part and Small Part.
- Define sets of external loads.
- For an external load, use Abaqus simulation to calculate the stress and strain throughout the part.
- According to the location of strain gauges, calculate the strain of strain gauges from strain distribution.
- Make the strain of strain gauges, external load, stress and strain distribution into csv files.
- Use Abaqus simulation parallelly to calculate all sets of external loads to obtain all the samples (each external load is a sample).

## AI model

### Input and output of neural networks

For each part, two neural networks are trained as AI model to solve the problem, named NNA and NNB.

**neural network A (NNA)**:

$$
\mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{k}
\xrightarrow{neural \: network \: A}
(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{M})^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 3}
$$

- **Input of NNA**: $\mathbf{C}$ is the strain of strain gauges. $k$ is the number of strain gauges on part. It is noteworthy that each strain gauge can only measure one direction of axes. So $\mathbf{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$, $\mathbf{C} \notin \mathbb{R}^{k \times 3}$. Precisely, the output only contains $k$ values. For Large Part, $k=8$. For Small Part, $k=6$.
$$
\mathbf{C} = (c^1, c^2, ...,c^k)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{k}
$$

- **Output of NNA**: $(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{M})^\top$ is external load. $\mathbf{F}$ is the total external force and $\mathbf{M}$ is the total external moment. Force and moment have 3 directions of axes so that $\mathbf{F} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$ and $\mathbf{M} \in \mathbb{R}^{3}$. Precisely, the output only contains 6 values.
$$
\mathbf{F} = (F_x, F_y, F_z)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{3}
$$
$$
\mathbf{M} = (M_x, M_y, M_z)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{3}
$$

**neural network B (NNB)**:

$$
(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{M})^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 3}
\xrightarrow{neural \: network \: B}
(\mathbf{S}, \mathbf{E})^\top \in (\mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}, \mathbb{R}^{n \times 6})^\top
$$

- **Input of NNB**: The same with the output of NNA. $(\mathbf{F}, \mathbf{M})^\top$ is external load. $\mathbf{F}$ is the total external force and $\mathbf{M}$ is the total external moment.

- **Output of NNB**: The output contains $\mathbf{S}$ is the mises stress and $\mathbf{E}$ is the six components of strain. $n$ is the number of elements on mesh of the part. It is noteworthy that the mises stress and strain are defined on element instead of node in this project. Precisely, the mises stress and strain are defined at the centroid location of element. Mises stress has no direction but strain has six components with directions. The output contains a large number of values, $7n$ values in total, far exceeding the input.

$$
\mathbf{S} = (s^1, s^2, ...,s^n)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}
$$
$$
\mathbf{E} = ((e^1_x, e^1_y, e^1_z, e^1_{xy}, e^1_{yz}, e^1_{zx},)^\top, ...,(e^n_x, e^n_y,..., e^n_{zx},)^\top)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 6}
$$
