# Stress and Strain AI Identification of Spacecraft Parts

This Project belongs to Beijing Institute of Spacecraft Environment Engineering (BISEE), cooperated with College of Engineering Peking University.

The code was developed by P.H. Zhang (2025).

## Background

The development of spacecraft represents the progress of modern society. Due to the unique characteristics of spacecraft motion and the space environment, high requirements are proposed on spacecraft parts. A key step during spacecraft part design is to quickly calculate the most dangerous location on part and overall stress and strain distribution under given working conditions.

Traditional methods use simulation software such as Abaqus to solve the problem. However, simulation software are slow, cumbersome, and having high learning threshold. A new approach is to use neural networks as surrogation of simulation software, which has high computational efficiency, significantly reduce time costs.

## Overview


## File Structure

Due to confidentiality requirements, some documents are not public and have not been uploaded. For example, the res.qrc and res_rc.py in /UI involve the structure picture of parts, which are confidential and not uploaded.

Uploaded files structure is as follows:
